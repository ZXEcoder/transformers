# Transformers from Scratch

This repository offers a ground-up implementation of the Transformer model, as introduced in the seminal paper "[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)". The Transformer architecture has become foundational in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks due to its efficiency and scalability.

## Overview

This project provides a minimalist and educational implementation of the Transformer model using Python and PyTorch. It's designed for those who wish to understand the inner workings of Transformers and experiment with the architecture.

## Features

- Encoder and Decoder modules with multi-head self-attention mechanisms.
- Positional encoding to capture sequence information.
- Layer normalization and residual connections for stable training.
- Configurable hyperparameters for experimentation.
- Training and inference scripts for model evaluation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZXEcoder/transformers.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd transformers
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. Then, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Configuration

The `config.py` file contains all the hyperparameters and configurations for the model, training process, and dataset paths. Adjust these parameters as needed before training or inference.

### Training

To train the Transformer model:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script will initiate the training process using the configurations specified in `config.py`. Ensure your dataset is prepared and its path is correctly set in the configuration file.

### Inference

For running inference and evaluating the model, you can use the provided Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook inference.ipynb
```

This notebook demonstrates how to load a trained model and perform inference on sample inputs.
